# Housing-monitor

This repo contains the routines to nowcast housing prices using a mixed-frequency Dynamic Factor model.

*Disclaimer:* this is an unfinished project and the repo will be updated regularly.

### Structure:

* `IHP_monitor.R`: main script executing data downloads*, data wrangling, and (classical) estimation of DFM.
* `/scripts`: subroutines to handle data, estimate ARMA model and DFM model, and create charts.
* `/functions`: auxiliary functions to estimate DFM.


*to be added to the repo when the project is finished.
